# patch slicing (text-only)

This folder previously held a reference patch built from `patch.wav`. All
binary artifacts (`.wav`, `.wav.info`, `.zip`) have been removed to keep the
repository text-only. If you need the outputs again, place your own `patch.wav`
alongside this README and run the tooling under `testfiles/tools/` to
regenerate slices into `bank1/` and a zip archive for distribution.
